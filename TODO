* Get a proper Dispatcher??
* Login can be brute forced. No account lockouts implemented.
* Past Auctions page should show winners for CBN account
* Remove money operations are not safe. Would be nice if they have an additional warning?

  How do I make it fail gracefully?
* Login form has no token. Session usually tied to user, how do I create tokens for unauthenticated user so login form cannot be attacked?
